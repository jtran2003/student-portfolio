            second year computer science student enrolled at the University of Toronto. I have learned and 
            implemented projects in various programming languages, such as Python, Java and C and have 
            studied the relative data structures and algorithms necessary to thrive in the field of computer 
            science. I have also collaborated with a team of university students for the game Boggers, where the 
            demo can be found by cliking the image below. We used software engineering principles and techniques, 
            such as the AGILE development method to efficiently create the project and manage it successfully. In 
            the future, I am going to further improve my programming skills by implementing new unique projects and 
            make me the most complete programmer that I can be.</p>
